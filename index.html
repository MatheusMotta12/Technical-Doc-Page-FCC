        JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is
        designed for creating network-centric applications. It is complimentary
        to and integrated with Java. JavaScript is very easy to implement
        because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight
        and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations
        allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic
        pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented
        capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name
        to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by
        Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with
        the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been
        embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.

        <h3>Syntax</h3>
      </header>
      <!--Text-->
      <p>
        JavaScript can be implemented using JavaScript statements that are
        placed within the &ltscript&gt... &lt/script&gt HTML tags in a web page.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can place the &ltscript&gt tags, containing your JavaScript,
        anywhere within your web page, but it is normally recommended that you
        should keep it within the &lthead&gt tags.
      </p>
      <p>
        The &ltscript&gt tag alerts the browser program to start interpreting
        all the text between these tags as a script. A simple syntax of your
        JavaScript will appear as follows.
      </p>
      <code
        >&lt...script&gt
        <p><i>JavaScript Code</i></p>
        &ltscript&gt
      </code>
      <p>The script tag takes two important attributes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Language:</b> This attribute specifies what scripting language you
          are using. Typically, its value will be javascript. Although recent
          versions of HTML (and XHTML, its successor) have phased out the use of
          this attribute.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Type:</b> This attribute is what is now recommended to indicate the
          scripting language in use and its value should be set to
          "text/javascript".
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>So your JavaScript segment will look like:</p>
      <code>
        &ltscript language = "javascript" type = "text/javascript"&gt<br />
        <i>Javascript code</i><br />
        &ltscript&gt
      </code>
      <!--Text-End-->

        <h3>Variables</h3>
      </header>
      <!--Text-->
      <h4>Data Types</h4>
      <p>
        One of the most fundamental characteristics of a programming language is
        the set of data types it supports. These are the type of values that can
        be represented and manipulated in a programming language.
      </p>
      <p>JavaScript allows you to work with three primitive data types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Numbers:</b> eg. 123, 120.50 etc.</li>
        <li><b>Strings of text:</b> e.g. "This text string" etc.</li>
        <li><b>Boolean:</b> e.g. true or false.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        JavaScript also defines two trivial data types, null and undefined, each
        of which defines only a single value. In addition to these primitive
        data types, JavaScript supports a composite data type known as object.
      </p>
      <h4>Variables</h4>
      <p>
        Like many other programming languages, JavaScript has variables.
        Variables can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into
        these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the
        container.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it.
        Variables are declared with the var keyword as follows.
      </p>
      <code>
        &ltscript type = "text/javascript"&gt<br />
        &lt!--<br />
        var money; var name;<br />
        //--&gt
      </code>
      <p>
        Storing a value in a variable is called variable initialization. You can
        do variable initialization at the time of variable creation or at a
        later point in time when you need that variable.
      </p>
      <code>
        &ltscript type = "text/javascript"&gt <br />
        &lt!-- <br />
        var name, money; <br />
        money = 2000.50; <br />
        //--&gt <br />
        &ltscript&gt
      </code>
      <p>
        JavaScript is untyped language. This means that a JavaScript variable
        can hold a value of any data type. Unlike many other languages, you
        don't have to tell JavaScript during variable declaration what type of
        value the variable will hold. The value type of a variable can change
        during the execution of a program and JavaScript takes care of it
        automatically

      <header>
        <h3>Scope</h3>
      </header>
      <!--Text-->
      <p>
        The scope of a variable is the region of your program in which it is
        defined. JavaScript variables have only two scopes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Global Variables:</b> A global variable has global scope which
          means it can be defined anywhere in your JavaScript code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Local Variables:</b> A local variable will be visible only within a
          function where it is defined. Function parameters are always local to
          that function.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Within the body of a function, a local variable takes precedence over a
        global variable with the same name. If you declare a local variable or
        function parameter with the same name as a global variable, you
        effectively hide the global variable.
      </p>

        <h3>Operators</h3>
      </header>
      <!--Text-->
      <p>
        Let us take a simple expression 4 + 5 is equal to 9. Here 4 and 5 are
        called operands and ‘+’ is called the operator.
      </p>
      <p>JavaScript supports the following types of operators.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
        <li>Comparison Operators</li>
        <li>Logical (or Relational) Operators</li>
        <li>Assignment Operators</li>
        <li>Conditional (or ternary) Operators</li>
